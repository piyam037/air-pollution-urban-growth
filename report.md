This visualization explores the relationship between urban population growth and PM2.5 exposure in 2019, segmented by World Bank income group classifications. The findings indicate only weak correlations overall, with slight positive correlations in higher-income groups. This could suggest that wealthier countries may have better infrastructure to manage pollution despite growing urbanization, whereas lower-income nations show minimal or negative correlations, potentially due to variability in industrialization and monitoring.
By grouping countries by income level, the visualization contextualizes environmental burdens within economic capacity. This segmentation enables more meaningful insights than a single aggregated plot would provide and underscores the need for tailored environmental policy strategies based on economic development levels.
